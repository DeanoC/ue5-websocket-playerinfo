## Notes and Progress Updates

This section will be used to track progress, note any issues encountered, and document decisions made during the implementation process.

### Current Status
We have completed all tasks in Phase 1: Project Setup, Phase 2: Redux Implementation, and Phase 3: IPC Integration.

For Phase 1, the package.json file has been updated with the necessary React, Redux, and TypeScript dependencies, the Vite configuration has been updated to support React and properly integrate with Electron, the TypeScript configuration has been updated to support React JSX syntax, the folder structure for React components and Redux store has been set up, and the inline styles have been extracted to an external CSS file.

For Phase 2, we have implemented the Redux store structure with the following components:
- Created connectionSlice.ts to manage connection status
- Created playerStatsSlice.ts to manage player statistics
- Created ipcMiddleware.ts to handle IPC events
- Configured the Redux store in index.ts to combine the slices and middleware

For Phase 3, we have completed the IPC integration:
- Designed and implemented the IPC middleware to handle communication between the main and renderer processes
- Updated the preload script to remove direct DOM manipulation and work with our Redux implementation

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed path format in vite.config.ts to use Windows-style backslashes instead of forward slashes, resolving IDE errors in the electron main segment.
- Updated electron plugin configuration in vite.config.ts to use the correct structure for vite-plugin-electron v0.15.5, resolving TypeScript error TS2353 about 'main' not existing in type ElectronOptions.

### Next Steps
The next phase is Phase 4: React Components, starting with Task 4.1: Create React Entry Point. We need to implement the React components that will use our Redux store to display the UI.
