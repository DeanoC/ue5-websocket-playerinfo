## Notes and Progress Updates

This section will be used to track progress, note any issues encountered, and document decisions made during the implementation process.

### Current Status
We have completed all tasks in Phase 1: Project Setup. The package.json file has been updated with the necessary React, Redux, and TypeScript dependencies, the Vite configuration has been updated to support React and properly integrate with Electron, the TypeScript configuration has been updated to support React JSX syntax, the folder structure for React components and Redux store has been set up, and the inline styles have been extracted to an external CSS file.

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed path format in vite.config.ts to use Windows-style backslashes instead of forward slashes, resolving IDE errors in the electron main segment.
- Updated electron plugin configuration in vite.config.ts to use the correct structure for vite-plugin-electron v0.15.5, resolving TypeScript error TS2353 about 'main' not existing in type ElectronOptions.

### Next Steps
The next phase is Phase 2: Redux Implementation, starting with Task 2.1: Design Redux Store. Before proceeding, we should check with the project manager to review the completed Phase 1 tasks and confirm that we're ready to move on to Phase 2.
