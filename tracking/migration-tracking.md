## Notes and Progress Updates

This section will be used to track progress, note any issues encountered, and document decisions made during the implementation process.

### Current Status
We have completed all tasks in Phase 1: Project Setup, Phase 2: Redux Implementation, Phase 3: IPC Integration, Phase 4: React Components, and Phase 5: Testing and Refinement.

For Phase 1, the package.json file has been updated with the necessary React, Redux, and TypeScript dependencies, the Vite configuration has been updated to support React and properly integrate with Electron, the TypeScript configuration has been updated to support React JSX syntax, the folder structure for React components and Redux store has been set up, and the inline styles have been extracted to an external CSS file.

For Phase 2, we have implemented the Redux store structure with the following components:
- Created connectionSlice.ts to manage connection status
- Created playerStatsSlice.ts to manage player statistics
- Created ipcMiddleware.ts to handle IPC events
- Configured the Redux store in index.ts to combine the slices and middleware

For Phase 3, we have completed the IPC integration:
- Designed and implemented the IPC middleware to handle communication between the main and renderer processes
- Updated the preload script to remove direct DOM manipulation and work with our Redux implementation

For Phase 4, we have implemented the React components:
- Created main.tsx as the React entry point with Redux Provider
- Implemented App.tsx as the main component
- Created Header, Footer, PlayerStatsDisplay, ConnectionStatus, StatsList, and StatItem components
- Updated index.html to work with React
- Created index.css for styling

For Phase 5, we have implemented comprehensive testing:
- Created unit tests for Redux reducers (connectionSlice and playerStatsSlice)
- Created unit tests for all React components
- Implemented integration tests to verify Redux and React interaction
- Created end-to-end tests to simulate the full application flow with IPC communication
- Set up a testing utility for components that use Redux

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed path format in vite.config.ts to use Windows-style backslashes instead of forward slashes, resolving IDE errors in the electron main segment.
- Updated electron plugin configuration in vite.config.ts to use the correct structure for vite-plugin-electron v0.15.5, resolving TypeScript error TS2353 about 'main' not existing in type ElectronOptions.
- Fixed issues in index.css: moved @import statement to the top of the file to resolve "Misplaced @import" warning and updated the path from '/style.css' to './style.css' to resolve "Cannot resolve file 'style.css'" error.
- Fixed issues in setup.ts: corrected the import path from '@testing-library/jest-dom/matchers' to '@testing-library/jest-dom' and added missing testing dependencies (vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom) to package.json.
- Fixed import path in index.css from './style.css' back to '/style.css' to correctly reference the file in the public directory.
- Updated reference in vite.config.ts from 'src\\main.ts' to 'src\\main.tsx' to match the React entry point.
- Updated reference in vite.config.js from 'src/main.ts' to 'src/main.tsx' to match the React entry point and be consistent with vite.config.ts.
- Fixed import statement in setup.ts from `import matchers from '@testing-library/jest-dom'` to `import * as matchers from '@testing-library/jest-dom'` to resolve TypeScript error TS2306: File 'D:/Projects/ue5-websocket-playerinfo/node_modules/@testing-library/jest-dom/types/index.d.ts' is not a module.
- Added optional chaining operator (?.) when calling window.connectionStatusCallback and window.playerStatsCallback in app-flow.test.tsx to resolve TypeScript error TS2722: Cannot invoke an object which is possibly 'undefined'.
- Removed unused React import from app-flow.test.tsx to resolve TypeScript warning TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read.
- Added comments to src/main.ts and src/index.html indicating they are deprecated and kept for reference only, to resolve IDE confusion between the old implementation and the new React implementation.
- Fixed TypeScript error TS2352 in playerStatsSlice.test.ts by updating the test object to include all required properties of the PlayerStats interface, resolving the error "Conversion of type '{ health: number; customStat1: string; customStat2: number; }' to type 'PlayerStats' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other."
- Fixed TypeScript error TS2345 in redux-react.test.tsx by adding all required properties of the PlayerStats interface to the test object, resolving the error "Argument of type '{ health: number; mana: number; customStat: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'PlayerStats'."
- Removed unused RootState import from test-utils.tsx to resolve TypeScript warning TS6133: 'RootState' is declared but its value is never read.
- Fixed issue with electron:dev script producing a white background by modifying the script to use vite build --mode development instead of just vite build, ensuring the React app is built in development mode with proper source maps and debugging information.

### Next Steps
All phases of the migration plan have been completed. The application has been successfully migrated from direct DOM manipulation to a React-based UI with Redux for state management. The next steps could include:

1. Deploying the application to users
2. Adding new features based on user feedback
3. Implementing performance optimizations if needed
4. Enhancing the UI with additional styling and animations
