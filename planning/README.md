# UE5 Player Stats Monitor - Migration Planning

This folder contains planning documents for migrating the UE5 Player Stats Monitor application from direct DOM manipulation to a React-based UI with Redux for state management.

## Overview

The current application uses direct DOM manipulation to update the UI based on WebSocket data received from UE5 games. The goal of this migration is to implement a more maintainable and scalable architecture using React and Redux while preserving all existing functionality.

## Documents in this Folder

### 1. [Migration Plan](migration-plan.md)

A high-level overview of the migration process, including:
- Current and target architecture
- Migration tasks
- Component structure
- Timeline and milestones

This document provides a strategic view of the migration and serves as a roadmap for the implementation.

### 2. [Technical Implementation Guide](technical-implementation-guide.md)

Detailed technical guidance for implementing the migration, including:
- Project setup instructions
- Redux implementation details
- React component implementation
- IPC integration
- CSS styling
- Testing strategy

This document provides concrete code examples and step-by-step instructions for each part of the migration.

### 3. [Task Breakdown](task-breakdown.md)

- Task list organized by phases
- Estimated effort for each task
- Dependencies between tasks
- Critical path analysis
- Parallel work opportunities
- Risk assessment
- Definition of done

This document helps with tracking progress and managing the implementation process.

## Migration Strategy

The migration will follow these key principles:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: The migration will be implemented in phases, with each phase building on the previous one.

2. **Preserve Functionality**: All existing functionality will be preserved throughout the migration.

3. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests will be written for each component to ensure functionality is maintained.

4. **Clean Architecture**: The new implementation will follow best practices for React and Redux development.

## Next Steps

After reviewing these planning documents, the next steps are:

1. Set up the project with React and Redux dependencies
2. Implement the Redux store and slices
3. Create React components
4. Integrate IPC with Redux
5. Test and refine the implementation

## Conclusion

This migration will result in a more maintainable and scalable application that preserves all existing functionality while providing a better foundation for future feature development.
