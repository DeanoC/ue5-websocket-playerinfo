# Migration Plan: Converting UE5 Player Stats Monitor to React with Redux

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to migrate the UE5 Player Stats Monitor application from direct DOM manipulation to a React-based UI with Redux for state management. The migration will preserve all existing functionality while providing a more maintainable and scalable architecture for future feature development.

## Current Architecture

The current application uses:
- Electron for the desktop application framework
- WebSockets (ws) for real-time communication with UE5 games
- TypeScript for type safety
- Direct DOM manipulation for UI updates
- IPC for communication between main and renderer processes

## Target Architecture

The migrated application will use:
- Electron (unchanged)
- WebSockets (unchanged)
- TypeScript (unchanged)
- React for UI components
- Redux for state management
- React-Redux for connecting React components to Redux store
- Redux Toolkit for simplified Redux development
- IPC (unchanged, but adapted to work with Redux)

## Migration Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Dependencies

1. **Add React and Redux Dependencies**
   - Install React: `npm install react react-dom`
   - Install Redux: `npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit`
   - Install TypeScript types: `npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom`

2. **Update Build Configuration**
   - Update Vite configuration to support React
   - Configure TypeScript for React

### 2. Redux Store Design

1. **Define Redux Store Structure**
   ```typescript
   interface RootState {
     connection: {
       isConnected: boolean;
     };
     playerStats: {
       health: number;
       mana: number;
       stamina: number;
       position: {
         x: number;
         y: number;
         z: number;
       };
       level: number;
       experience: number;
       [key: string]: any; // For custom stats
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Create Redux Slices**
   - Create a connectionSlice for managing connection status
   - Create a playerStatsSlice for managing player statistics

3. **Set Up Redux Store**
   - Configure the store with the slices
   - Set up Redux DevTools for development

### 3. React Component Structure

1. **Component Hierarchy**
   ```
   App
   ├── Header
   ├── PlayerStatsDisplay
   │   ├── ConnectionStatus
   │   └── StatsList
   │       └── StatItem
   └── Footer
   ```

2. **Component Responsibilities**
   - `App`: Main application container
   - `Header`: Application title and branding
   - `PlayerStatsDisplay`: Container for player stats
   - `ConnectionStatus`: Shows connection status to UE5 game
   - `StatsList`: Container for stat items
   - `StatItem`: Individual stat display

### 4. IPC Integration with Redux

1. **Create IPC Middleware for Redux**
   - Implement middleware to handle IPC events
   - Dispatch Redux actions when IPC events are received

2. **Update Preload Script**
   - Modify the preload script to work with Redux
   - Remove direct DOM manipulation from preload script

### 5. Implementation Steps

1. **Create Basic React Structure**
   - Set up React entry point
   - Create basic App component
   - Render React app in index.html

2. **Implement Redux Store**
   - Create store configuration
   - Implement connection slice
   - Implement player stats slice

3. **Create React Components**
   - Implement all components in the hierarchy
   - Style components to match current design

4. **Connect Components to Redux**
   - Use React-Redux hooks to connect components to store
   - Implement selectors for accessing state

5. **Integrate IPC with Redux**
   - Implement IPC middleware
   - Update preload script
   - Test IPC communication

6. **Refine and Test**
   - Test all functionality
   - Ensure real-time updates work correctly
   - Verify connection status updates

### 6. File Structure

```
src/
├── main.tsx                 # React entry point
├── App.tsx                  # Main App component
├── components/              # React components
│   ├── Header.tsx
│   ├── Footer.tsx
│   ├── PlayerStatsDisplay.tsx
│   ├── ConnectionStatus.tsx
│   ├── StatsList.tsx
│   └── StatItem.tsx
├── store/                   # Redux store
│   ├── index.ts             # Store configuration
│   ├── connectionSlice.ts   # Connection state slice
│   └── playerStatsSlice.ts  # Player stats state slice
└── utils/                   # Utility functions
    └── ipcMiddleware.ts     # IPC middleware for Redux
```

### 7. Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test Redux reducers
   - Test React components

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test IPC communication
   - Test Redux store integration with React

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test full application flow
   - Test WebSocket communication

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Project Setup (Day 1)**
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure build tools

2. **Redux Store Implementation (Day 2)**
   - Design store structure
   - Implement slices

3. **React Component Development (Days 3-4)**
   - Create component hierarchy
   - Implement and style components

4. **IPC Integration (Day 5)**
   - Implement IPC middleware
   - Connect IPC to Redux

5. **Testing and Refinement (Days 6-7)**
   - Test all functionality
   - Fix issues
   - Refine UI

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to converting the UE5 Player Stats Monitor from direct DOM manipulation to a React-based UI with Redux for state management. The plan preserves all existing functionality while providing a more maintainable and scalable architecture for future feature development.

By following this plan, the application will be better positioned for adding new features, improving the UI, and maintaining the codebase over time.
