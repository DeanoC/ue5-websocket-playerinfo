| 3.2 | Implement IPC Middleware | Create middleware to dispatch Redux actions on IPC events | 4 hours | 3.1 |
| 3.3 | Update Preload Script | Modify preload script to remove DOM manipulation | 2 hours | 3.2 |

### Phase 4: React Components (Estimated: 2 days)

| ID | Task | Description | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|----|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 4.1 | Create React Entry Point | Set up main.tsx as React entry point | 1 hour | 1.4 |
| 4.2 | Implement App Component | Create main App component | 1 hour | 4.1 |
| 4.3 | Implement Header Component | Create Header component | 1 hour | 4.2 |
| 4.4 | Implement Footer Component | Create Footer component | 1 hour | 4.2 |
| 4.5 | Implement PlayerStatsDisplay Component | Create container for player stats | 2 hours | 4.2 |
| 4.6 | Implement ConnectionStatus Component | Create component for connection status | 2 hours | 4.5, 2.2, 3.2 |
| 4.7 | Implement StatsList Component | Create component for listing stats | 3 hours | 4.5, 2.3, 3.2 |
| 4.8 | Implement StatItem Component | Create component for individual stat items | 2 hours | 4.7 |
| 4.9 | Update HTML | Modify index.html for React | 1 hour | 4.1 |

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Estimated: 2 days)

| ID | Task | Description | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|----|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 5.1 | Unit Test Redux Reducers | Create tests for Redux reducers | 4 hours | 2.2, 2.3 |
| 5.2 | Unit Test React Components | Create tests for React components | 6 hours | 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 |
| 5.3 | Integration Test | Test integration between Redux and React | 4 hours | 5.1, 5.2 |
| 5.4 | End-to-End Test | Test full application flow | 4 hours | 5.3 |
| 5.5 | Fix Issues | Address any issues found during testing | 4 hours | 5.4 |
| 5.6 | Refine UI | Polish UI and improve user experience | 4 hours | 5.5 |

## Critical Path

The critical path for this migration is:

1. Project Setup (Phase 1)
2. Redux Implementation (Phase 2)
3. IPC Integration (Phase 3)
4. React Components (Phase 4)
5. Testing and Refinement (Phase 5)

## Parallel Work Opportunities

Some tasks can be worked on in parallel:

- CSS files (1.5) can be created while implementing Redux store (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Unit tests for Redux reducers (5.1) can be started as soon as the reducers are implemented (2.2, 2.3)
- Component implementation (4.3, 4.4) can be done in parallel once the App component (4.2) is created

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| IPC integration issues | High | Medium | Create thorough tests for IPC communication |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Profile application before and after migration |
| Breaking existing functionality | High | Medium | Implement comprehensive test suite |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Low | Use package.json to manage dependencies carefully |

## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. Code is written and follows project coding standards
2. Tests are written and passing
3. Code is reviewed by at least one other developer
4. Documentation is updated to reflect changes
5. The feature works as expected in the development environment

## Conclusion

This task breakdown provides a structured approach to implementing the migration from direct DOM manipulation to React with Redux. By following this plan, the team can track progress, identify bottlenecks, and ensure that all aspects of the migration are addressed.
