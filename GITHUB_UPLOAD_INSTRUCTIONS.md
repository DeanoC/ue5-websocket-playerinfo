# GitHub Upload Instructions

Follow these steps to upload your project to GitHub:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a name for your repository (e.g., "UE5-Player-Stats-Monitor")
4. Optionally add a description
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. **Important**: Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license as you already have these files locally
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote (replace the URL with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git

# Verify that the remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## 3. Verify the upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and the commit history

## 4. Additional information

- If you're using SSH for GitHub authentication, use the SSH URL instead: `git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git`
- If you encounter authentication issues, make sure you have set up authentication correctly:
  - For HTTPS: Use a personal access token or GitHub CLI
  - For SSH: Make sure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account

## 5. Future workflow

After the initial push, you can use the following commands for your regular workflow:

```bash
# Pull changes from GitHub
git pull origin master

# Add changes to staging
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin master
```
